# About Hoax Cherry
I develop open source projects and host them on GitHub!

---
👋 Hi! I’m a **computer engineering** student based in IST with a passion for **web development** and **repurposing old tech**.

I love modernizing outdated devices by tweaking their software, or taking old ideas and design trends and renovating them to show them off on modern hardware.

If you’ve enjoyed any of my work or just want to support a student developer, feel free to buy me a coffee ^^ ☕ Every bit of support helps me keep learning, experimenting, and bringing cool ideas to life.
